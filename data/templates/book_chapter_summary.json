The field has evolved significantly since Arthur Samuel coined the term in 1959. Today, machine learning powers everything from email spam filters to autonomous vehicles.\n\nThe three main types of machine learning are supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. In supervised learning, the algorithm learns from labeled training data. Unsupervised learning finds patterns in unlabeled data. Reinforcement learning involves an agent learning through trial and error in an environment.",
    "output": "**Chapter Summary: Introduction to Machine Learning**\n\n**Main Ideas:**\n1. Machine learning is a branch of AI that allows systems to learn from experience rather than explicit programming\n2. The field originated in 1959 with Arthur Samuel and has grown to power many modern technologies\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n- Three main types: supervised (learns from labeled data), unsupervised (finds patterns in unlabeled data), and reinforcement learning (trial and error)\n- Applications range from simple (spam filters) to complex (autonomous vehicles)\n- The core principle is learning from data rather than hardcoded rules"

    "input": "Chapter: The Art of Communication\n\nEffective communication is the cornerstone of all human relationships, both personal and professional. Studies show that 93% of communication is non-verbal, including body language, tone of voice, and facial expressions. Only 7% consists of the actual words we use.\n\nActive listening is perhaps the most important skill in communication. It involves fully concentrating on what is being said rather than passively hearing. Techniques include maintaining eye contact, nodding, and paraphrasing what the speaker has said to confirm understanding.",
    "output": "**Chapter Summary: The Art of Communication**\n\n**Main Ideas:**\n1. Communication extends far beyond words - 93% is non-verbal (body language, tone, expressions)\n2. Active listening is the foundation of effective communication\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n- Non-verbal cues carry more weight than spoken words\n- Active listening requires full concentration, not passive hearing\n- Practical techniques: eye contact, nodding, paraphrasing to confirm understanding\n- Communication skills are essential for both personal and professional success"

    "input": "Chapter: Financial Planning Basics\n\nThe 50/30/20 budgeting rule provides a simple framework for managing personal finances. Under this system, 50% of after-tax income goes to needs (housing, utilities, groceries), 30% to wants (entertainment, dining out), and 20% to savings and debt repayment.\n\nEmergency funds are crucial for financial security. Most financial advisors recommend saving 3-6 months of living expenses. This fund should be kept in a liquid, accessible account and only used for genuine emergencies like job loss or medical bills.",
